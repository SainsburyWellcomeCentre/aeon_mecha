"""Creating the Social 0.1 schema"""

# Above we've listed out all the streams we recorded from during Social0.1, but we won't care to analyze all
# of them. Instead, we'll create a DotMap schema from Device objects that only contains Readers for the
# streams we want to analyze.

# We'll see both examples of binder functions we saw previously: 1. "empty pattern", and
# 2. "device-name passed".

# And we'll see both examples of instantiating Device objects we saw previously: 1. from singleton binder
# functions; 2. from multiple and/or nested binder functions.

# (Note, in the simplest case, a schema can always be created from / reduced to  "empty pattern" binder
# functions as singletons in Device objects.)

# Metadata.yml (will be a singleton binder function Device object)
