"""Start an Aeon ingestion process.

This script defines auto-processing routines to operate the DataJoint pipeline for the Aeon project. Three separate "process" functions are defined to call `populate()` for different groups of tables, depending on their priority in the ingestion routines (high, mid, low).

Each process function is run in a while-loop with the total run-duration configurable via command line argument '--duration' (if not set, runs perpetually)
    - the loop will not begin a new cycle after this period of time (in seconds)
    - the loop will run perpetually if duration<0 or if duration==None
    - the script will not be killed _at_ this limit, it will keep executing,
        and just stop repeating after the time limit is exceeded

Usage as a console entrypoint:

        aeon_ingest high_priority
        aeon_ingest mid_priority -d 600 -s 60
        aeon_ingest --help


Usage as a script:

    python ./aeon/dj_pipeline/populate/process.py --help


Usage from python:

    `from aeon.dj_pipeline.populate.process import run; run(worker_name='high_priority', duration=20, sleep=5)`
