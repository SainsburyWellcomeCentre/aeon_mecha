# Ephys Pipeline Testing Specification

Testing strategy for the electrophysiology (spike sorting) pipeline, covering epoch discovery through synced spike times.

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-26

## Overview

The ephys test suite parallels the existing behavior tests in `test_full_ingestion.py`. It exercises the full ephys ingestion pipeline from epoch discovery through spike time synchronization, using a golden dataset — a reduced 8-channel extract of real NeuropixelsV2 data.

Tests are integration tests that require a database and golden dataset files. They gracefully skip when the data is unavailable.

---

## Golden Dataset

### What it is

An 8-channel subset of a real NeuropixelsV2 ProbeB recording from the `social-ephys0.1-aeon3` experiment, plus pre-computed KS4 sorting output. The reduction from 384 to 8 channels makes the data small enough for fast test runs (~2 min) while still exercising every pipeline stage.

### Contents

| Component | Size | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `AmplifierData_0.bin` | 1,008 MB | 63M samples × 8 channels × uint16 |
| `Clock_0.bin` | 504 MB | 63M samples × int64 (ONIX timestamps) |
| `HarpSync_*.csv` (3) | ~KB | ONIX↔HARP clock regression data |
| `Metadata.yml` | ~KB | Epoch metadata (device config, gains) |
| `M81_ProbeB_*.json` | ~KB | Probeinterface channel map (remapped to 0-7) |
| `golden_test_sorting/` | ~50 MB | Pre-computed KS4 output (14 units) |

**Source recording:** `social-ephys0.1-aeon3`, epoch `2026-05-11T07-50-11`, subject `IAA-1147881`, electrodes 3982–3989 on shank 3. Duration: 35 minutes continuous.

**Sorting details:** Kilosort4 with modified parameters for small channel count (`nblocks=0`, `Th_universal=8`, `Th_learned=7`). Produced 14 units (7 good, 7 MUA), 357,480 total spikes.

```

**Local test copy (per-user):**
```
~/sciops-data/project_aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEONX1/abcGolden01/
```

Note: the local path uses `raw/` while Ceph uses `golden_tests/`. This is because the test code expects data under `DEFAULT_GOLDEN_DATA_ROOT / "raw"`, and the golden data is a modified extract (not production data) so it lives in a separate Ceph directory.

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get the golden data

From the HPC (or any machine with Ceph access), rsync the golden dataset to your local home directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/sciops-data/project_aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEONX1/abcGolden01
rsync -avP /ceph/aeon/aeon/data/golden_tests/AEONX1/abcGolden01/ \
    ~/sciops-data/project_aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEONX1/abcGolden01/
```

If running from outside the HPC (e.g., your local machine):
```bash
rsync -avP aeon-hpc:/ceph/aeon/aeon/data/golden_tests/AEONX1/abcGolden01/ \
    ~/sciops-data/project_aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEONX1/abcGolden01/
```

### 2. Clone the branch

```bash
git clone -b es/ephys-tests https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/aeon_mecha.git aeon_mecha_ephys-tests
cd aeon_mecha_ephys-tests
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
module load uv
uv sync --all-extras
```

### 4. Database configuration

The tests need access to a DataJoint-compatible database. Set the `TEST_DB_PREFIX` environment variable to use an existing database connection (via `datajoint.json` + `.secrets/`):

```bash
export TEST_DB_PREFIX=u_<username>_golden_tests_
```

This creates test schemas prefixed with that string (e.g., `u_thinh_golden_tests_ephys`). Schemas are dropped automatically after the test session.

If `TEST_DB_PREFIX` is not set, the tests attempt to use testcontainers (Docker-based ephemeral MySQL). This works locally but not on HPC where Docker is unavailable.

**DataJoint config files:** If your clone doesn't have `datajoint.json` and `.secrets/`, symlink from an existing working directory:

```bash
ln -s ~/ProjectAeon/foragingABC_analysis/datajoint.json .
ln -s ~/ProjectAeon/foragingABC_analysis/.secrets .
```

### 5. Run tests

```bash
# Get onto a compute node (Ceph is not visible from the gateway)
srun --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=8G --time=2:00:00 --pty bash

cd ~/ProjectAeon/aeon_mecha_ephys-tests
export TEST_DB_PREFIX=u_<username>_golden_tests_
module load uv

# Run all ephys integration tests
uv run pytest -m integration tests/dj_pipeline/test_ephys_ingestion.py -v --tb=short

# Run a single test class
uv run pytest -m integration tests/dj_pipeline/test_ephys_ingestion.py::TestPreProcessing -v --tb=short
```

Tests take approximately 2 minutes for the full suite.

## Test Coverage

### Pipeline stages tested

The tests follow the ephys pipeline cascade in order. Each stage depends on the previous.

| Test Class | Pipeline Stage | What it verifies |
|------------|---------------|------------------|
| `TestEphysEpochDiscovery` | EphysEpoch, ProbeInsertion | Epoch creation, probe discovery, subject linking |
| `TestEphysChunkIngestion` | EphysChunk | Chunk file registration, timestamp validity |
| `TestEphysBlockInfo` | EphysBlockInfo | Block timing, chunk association, channel mappings |
| `TestPreProcessing` | PreProcessing | Binary recording creation, file registration |
| `TestPostProcessing` | PostProcessing | Sorting analyzer creation from golden KS4 output |
| `TestSortedSpikes` | SortedSpikes | Unit extraction, spike counts, quality labels |
| `TestSyncedSpikes` | SyncedSpikes | ONIX→HARP timestamp synchronization |

### Test list (25 tests)

**TestEphysEpochDiscovery** (6 tests):
- Epoch entry exists in DB
- `has_ephys` flag is set
- Correct number of probes discovered (1 — ProbeB only)
- ProbeInsertion entries created
- ProbeInsertion links to correct subject
- `discover_epoch_probes()` returns expected probe labels

**TestEphysChunkIngestion** (3 tests):
- Chunks ingested for the experiment
- Chunk timestamps are valid datetimes
- Chunk files registered in DB

**TestEphysBlockInfo** (4 tests):
- Block info populated
- Block duration matches expected value
- Block-chunk associations exist
- Channel mappings created (8 channels)

**TestPreProcessing** (3 tests):
- PreProcessing entry populated (runs `write_binary_recording`)
- Recording files registered in DB
- `recording.dat` binary file exists on disk

**TestPostProcessing** (2 tests):
- PostProcessing entry populated (runs quality metrics)
- Sorting analyzer artifact created

**TestSortedSpikes** (4 tests):
- Sorted spikes populated
- Unit count matches expected (14 units)
- Spike counts are reasonable (> 0 for each unit)
- Quality labels assigned (good/mua/noise)

**TestSyncedSpikes** (3 tests):
- Synced spikes populated
- Spike times have datetime64 dtype (confirms sync model ran)
- All spike times fall within the sync model's calibrated HARP time range

### How SpikeSorting is handled

The tests do NOT run Kilosort4 (requires GPU + Singularity container). Instead, the `ephys_sorting_injected` fixture:

1. Runs PreProcessing.populate() normally (creates `recording.dat`)
2. Copies the pre-computed golden sorting output into the pipeline's expected directory
3. Force-inserts a SpikeSorting entry with `allow_direct_insert=True`
4. PostProcessing, SortedSpikes, and SyncedSpikes then populate normally through the real pipeline code

---

## Key Design Decisions

### External DB support (`TEST_DB_PREFIX`)

HPC has no Docker, so testcontainers can't run there. When `TEST_DB_PREFIX` is set, the tests use the host's `datajoint.json` configuration and prefix all schema names with the given string. This isolates test schemas from production data.

### Golden data is modified, not production

Unlike the behavior golden dataset (which is unmodified production data rsynced directly from `/ceph/aeon/aeon/data/raw/`), the ephys golden dataset is a modified extract:

- 8 channels extracted from 384 (reduces data from ~50 GB to ~1.5 GB)
- Probeinterface JSON `device_channel_indices` remapped from 384-channel positions to 0-7
- ProbeA stub files removed (only ProbeB retained)

This is why it lives in `/ceph/aeon/aeon/data/golden_tests/` rather than `/ceph/aeon/aeon/data/raw/`.

### No `specialized` test tier

All ephys tests are marked `integration`. The `specialized` tier (for GPU-dependent tests) was considered but deferred — KS4 sorting is injected from pre-computed output rather than run live.

## Troubleshooting

**Tests skip with "Golden data root not found":**
Run the rsync command from the setup instructions. The tests expect data at `~/sciops-data/project_aeon/aeon/data/raw/AEONX1/abcGolden01/`.

**Tests skip with "Golden sorting output not found":**
Make sure you rsynced the full `golden_tests/` directory, including `golden_test_sorting/`.

**"Cannot touch /ceph/..." or Ceph not visible:**
You're on the gateway (`hpc-gw2`). Ceph is only accessible from compute nodes. Use `srun` to get onto one first.

**Schema drop warnings in teardown:**
The teardown drops schemas in arbitrary order, which can hit foreign key constraints. These warnings are cosmetic — the schemas get cleaned up on the next test run.

**Stale test schemas from a crashed run:**
If a previous run crashed without cleanup, manually drop the schemas:
```bash
.venv/bin/python << 'EOF'
import datajoint as dj
dj.config.safemode = False
for s in dj.list_schemas():
    if s.startswith('u_<username>_golden_tests_'):
        print(f'Dropping {s}')
        dj.Schema(s).drop()
EOF
```
