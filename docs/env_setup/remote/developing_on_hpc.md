In the examples below, replace `<your_username>` with your SWC HPC username.

# Developing while on the HPC

1. After you've finished creating the virtual `aeon` environment, activate the environment. Then, add this repository to your python path within the activated environment by opening a terminal and running `pip install -e <path_to_aeon_mecha>`.
2. For using an IDE (e.g. PyCharm, VSCode, Jupyter, etc.), you will need to set up local port forwarding from a specified port on the HPC. These instructions can typically be found in your IDE's online documentation. [Here are instructions for PyCharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-remote-interpreters-via-ssh.html), and [here for VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).
